        <h1>Seri Park_Communication Design Major_Class of 2022</h1>
        <h3>Q. Tell me a bit about your background and what prompted you to take this class.</h3>
        <p>I am a designer but I always wanted to explore the area of developer as well as publisher. I thought the first step is to learn what the 'computer' is, and be familiar with it, so I believe that HTML and CSS would be a good start. </p>
        <h3>Q. Do you have any experinece with HTML/CSS/JS? If so, tell me a bit about it.</h3>
        <p>I do not have any expereince with HTML/CSS, but I took CSE131.</p>
        <h3>Q. Name one thing you hope to learn in this class.</h3>
        <p>I hope to understand how the browsers and the sites are built and shown differently.</p>
        <h3>Q.Name one way you expect designing for screen to be different from designing for paper.</h3>
        <p>I believe that sketching(thumbnails) the design is critical for both designing for screen and designing for paper. However, one of the things different from designing for paper is that when designing for screen, the designer needs to think about whether those designs could be coded and needs to consider certain rules and structures for the screen. There are some limitations in designing for screen, so it is important to think about the coding part while designing.</p>
        <h3>Q. Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective design. Explain your choice.</h3>
        <p>Example : https://orus-executivesearch.com/en/ </p>
        <p>These days, using the full-width of the page is the trend. This website not only uses the full-width but also uses the principles of design such as unity, balance, and space very well. JavaScript is well used in a pleasing way.
        </p>
        <h3>Q. Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective communication. Explain your choice. </h3>
        <p>Example : https://www.franshalsmuseum.nl/en/visit/exhibitions-events/who/friend </p>
        <p>This website has a clear navigation bar on the left. By having three depths opened, the users do not have to hover or click it and can immediately navigate through the website. It is communicating well with the users by using the horizontal scroll for the paintings and artworks.
        </p>
        <h3>Q. Provide a link to a website you think works well. Explain your choice.</h3>
        <p>Example : https://www.stickylemon.nl/products</p>
        <p>I think most of the websites advertising sells have certain rules with designing and structuring the website. "Sticky lemon" also follows those rules and has a clear labels on each box of the products, but I think it is much more clear because of the use of different colors and small amount of products. Each decision of the design and structure such as the typography, grid system, margins, colors is all going well together. It is easy to use and communicating the products and their prices well with the users.
