            <h2>Self Assessment</h2>
            <p>My design approach to this "Bibimbop" recipe page was to arouse viewers' interest as well as make them wonder the merit of this food. Since the food itself and the images I chose already have various colors, I tried to limit the colors I used in the page, but matched up the title colors with the colors in the images for consistency.</p>
            <p>For better understanding, I put images under the steps that need further explanation. </p>
            <p>I designed the "tip" part differently to emphasize the necessity of making. <span>For the people who want this food to be perfect, please do keep an eye on it!</span></p>
            <ul>
                <li>under 640px, maybe a little bit of space on left and right margins. (a bit tight)</li>
                <li>under 450px, only span tag font size is not getting bigger, so maybe make 0.1rem bigger </li>
                <li>maybe consider making the image under instructions #3 come to the center? (for the consistency when the page is shrunk)</li>
                <li>maybe design-wise emphasize more on the Ingredients & Instructions?</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Peers feedback</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Very nice with the tip emphaize! Looks professional with iamges under the instructions.</li>
                <li>Consider setting the sub header top and bottom margin consistent.</li>
                <li>Consider making the overall font sizes a bit bigger.</li>
                <li>Very nice with use of different colors in the title, but current yellow is not really legible.</li>
            </ul>
