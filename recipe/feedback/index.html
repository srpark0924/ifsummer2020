            <h2>Self Assessment</h2>
            <p>My design approach to this "Bibimbop" recipe page was to arouse viewers' interest as well as make them wonder the merit of this food. Since the food itself and the images I chose already have various colors, I tried to limit the colors I used in the page, but matched up the title colors with the colors in the images for consistency.</p>
            <p>For better understanding, I put images under the steps that need further explanation. </p>
            <p>I designed the "tip" part differently to emphasize the necessity of making. <span>For the people who want this food to be perfect, please do keep an eye on it!</span></p>
            <h4>What I like about my page</h4>
            <p>I think consistency of the colors, images and the texts work well as I payed a lot of attention to it</p>
            <p>Emphasis is highlighted with the bold text weight and in both context-wise and design-wise, "tip" shows the empahsis.</p>
            <p>For legibility, balance and proportion are another parts I tried to be consistent with</p>
            <p>Overall, as my main focus was to deliver the purpose of the page, which is arousing viewers' interest and make them want to follow it, I did accomplish the purpose, but could be even better with a bit more style design by using "position".</p>
            <h4>Place I made compromises</h4>
            <p>Like I stated below in "things for change," I originally wanted to make the ingredients and instructions part to stand out a little by making the border around the div tag without the unnecessary space on the left or right. However, though I tried several things such as changing the width of them, changing the display type, or giving padding or margins, it did not show the way I wanted it to be.</p>
            <h4>Things for change</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>under 640px, maybe a little bit of space on left and right margins. (a bit tight)</li>
                <li>under 450px, only span tag font size is not getting bigger, so maybe make 0.1rem bigger </li>
                <li>maybe consider making the image under instructions #3 come to the center? (for the consistency when the page is shrunk)</li>
                <li>maybe design-wise emphasize more on the Ingredients & Instructions?</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

            <h2>Peers feedback - Emily & Lilia</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Very nice with the tip emphaize! Looks professional with iamges under the instructions.</li>
                <li>Consider setting the sub header top and bottom margin consistent.</li>
                <li>Consider making the overall font sizes a bit bigger.</li>
                <li>Very nice with use of different colors in the title, but current yellow is not really legible.</li>
            </ul>
